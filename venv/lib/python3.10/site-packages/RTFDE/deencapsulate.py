De-encapsulation enables previously encapsulated HTML and plain text content to be extracted and rendered as HTML and plain text instead of the encapsulating RTF content. After de-encapsulation, the HTML and plain text should differ only minimally from the original HTML or plain text content.


Parameters:
    raw_rtf: (bytes): It's the raw RTF file as bytes.
    grammar: (str): OPTIONAL - Lark parsing grammar which defines the RTF language. https://github.com/lark-parser/lark If you think my grammar is shoddy this is your chance to test out a better one and make a pull request.

Attributes:
    content: (bytes) The deencapsulated content no matter what format it is in. Populated by the `deencapsulate` function.
    html: (bytes) The deencapsulated content IF it is HTML content. Populated by the `set_content` function.
    text: (bytes) The deencapsulated content IF it is plain text content. Populated by the `set_content` function.
    found_binary: List of dictionaries containing binary data extracted from the rtf file.
    content_type: The type of content encapsulated in .rtf data (html or text). Populated by the `get_content_type` function.
    full_tree: The full .rtf object parsed into an object Tree using the grammar. Populated by the `parse_rtf` function.
    doc_tree: The `document` portion of the .rtf full_tree object.
    raw_rtf: The raw encapsulated .rtf data in byte format.
    grammar: The Lark parsing grammer used to parse the .rtf data.
    content_type_token: The .rtf header token identifying the content type. (\\fromhtml1 OR \\fromtext)
    parser: The lark parser. Should not need to be manipulated directly. But, useful for debugging and saving the parsed object.
